# VacuumGame
This is a two player text based game. The aim of the game is to collect as many dust balls as possible. The user that collects the most dust balls wins. You cannot collect an unlimited amount of dust balls at once - like a physical vacuum, you have to empty the vacuum when it gets full.

Some starter code was provided by my instructors. This was an assignment I completed for my Software Design class.
